My website

This is the code which I will use to learn to create a website.
I want to get familiar with the use of Github to host the website while potentially holding downloadables on a seperate server.
I will probably start with a basic "tree" of a website and then make it look nice and possibly mobile-friendly afterwards.
I want to figure out todolists as well, so I don't clutter up this readme with anymore rambling thoughts...
how do you make a website which identifies if you're on mobile or desktop and changes layout accordingly?
